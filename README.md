# CV

## IRYNA DUNETS
*Highly motivated and versatile professional with a diverse background spanning finance, auditing, and manufacturing. Currently pursuing a career transition into the dynamic field of IT, with a particular focus on software testing and development. As a recent graduate of the HyperionDev Full Stack Web Developer bootcamp, I possess a strong foundation in MERN stack development, encompassing both frontend and backend technologies.

My experience as an accountant and auditor in the financial industry in Ukraine, coupled with my hands-on experience at Technicolor Poland, has honed my analytical and problem-solving skills. I bring a unique perspective to the IT field, underpinned by a strong work ethic and a commitment to delivering results.

My goal is to secure an entry-level position as a Software Tester, front-end developer (with expertise in React and Redux), or full-stack developer (with proficiency in React and NodeJS). I am actively seeking opportunities in Edinburgh, Glasgow, or remote roles that offer a supportive environment for ongoing learning, skill development, and career growth.

I am well-versed in a range of programming languages, including JavaScript, ES6, and backend technologies like PHP, Ruby, Python, and Java. Furthermore, I have experience with various frameworks and libraries, such as React, Redux, Angular, and Bootstrap, and have worked with databases like MS SQL and MySQL. My skill set also includes server technologies, notably Node.js.

My experience extends to financial and accounting roles from 2004 to 2019, giving me a solid foundation in managing financial transactions, budgeting, and reporting. In addition, I have served as an auditor, specializing in Chain-of-Custody standards for forest products.

I am fluent in multiple languages, including native Ukrainian and intermediate English, with a good grasp of Russian and a basic understanding of Polish. My education includes a degree from the Lviv Polytechnic State University and Lviv State University, and I have completed additional courses and training programs to enhance my IT and development skills.

As a dedicated, adaptable, and detail-oriented professional, I am poised to contribute my unique skill set and eager to embark on a rewarding career in the IT industry. I am confident in my ability to bring a fresh perspective to the sector and make valuable contributions to any team I join.*
